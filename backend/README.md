# Ecommerce 
## Backend 
### To get deeper insight of the Backend of our Project *Ecommerce* have a look at the following steps:
- Download the code folder from GitHub
- Create a **.env** file inside the backend folder having two variables - **DATABASE & SECRET**
- Open cmd and go to the backend folder directory and run the "**npm install**" command
- Then "**npm run**".
- We'll see that the backend server is running at **localhost:8000**.

**For testing in postman:**
- Write the route: http://localhost:8000/api/ **route** (Here, the route has to be taken from routes folder.)
